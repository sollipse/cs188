This is code compiled for a series of exercises in the UC Berkeley course CS188 --MACHINE LEARNING.

The Python package files for the game itself are proprietary to the UC Berkeley Course Staff for CS188. 

Student modifications to this package can be found in ghostAgents.py, game.py, pacmanAgents.py and searchAgents.py.

The purpose of this repo is to indicate a grasp of basic search structures, from practically implementing BFS and DFS with counter().util, to adjusting features and implementing rudimentary Q-Learning concepts in pacManAgents.py.
